# LetMeCompress
By default the game lowers the time compression to 1x when in combat, this mod removes that so you can enjoy War on the Sea combat without havng to wait 2 hours. 

### Installation 

Install BepInEx by following this [guide](https://docs.bepinex.dev/master/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html), after the first run, download `LetMeCompress.dll` from the release page here and save it to `War on the Sea\BepInEx\plugins\LetMeCompress\LetMeCompress.dll`. Now start the game and the time compression limitations should be gone!

Open an issue if there's an error.

### Development

Make sure you have Visual Studio/Rider configured with the .NET Framework workloads. This project uses .NET 3.5.     
Read `src/lib/notice.txt` on where to get required libraries.
